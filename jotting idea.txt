use one hot encoding car models (need to figure out how to convert for inputs, maybe just use df("model-" + userin) or you can make a drop down),
figure out nice way to deal with registration date fuck it we use year, 
one hot encode da colours too
power is just number, nice
transmission, fuel type one hot
fuel consumption l/100km is number (need to format it tho)
mileage is number

drop unnamed, brand, regdate, power_ps, fuel g/100km, offer description


get rid of redundant variables (e.g fuel consumption)!!!
fuck one hot encoding (just use integer conversion, just make sure that you are sorted by model alphabetically)!!!!
fuck colours
